            "3. **Heritability**: The traits of an organism are determined by its genetic makeup, which is passed on from one generation to the next.\n",
            "4. **Adaptation**: Organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to their offspring.\n",

            "2. **Environmental Pressure**: The environment presents challenges and opportunities that affect the survival and reproduction of individuals with different traits.\n",
            "3. **Selection**: Individuals with traits that are better suited to the environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, while those with less suitable traits are more likely to die off or fail to reproduce.\n",
            "4. **Accumulation of Adaptations**: Over time, the population becomes increasingly adapted to its environment as the advantageous traits become more common.\n",
