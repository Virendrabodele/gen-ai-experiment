His work revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and energy, leading to groundbreaking advancements in various scientific fields. Einstein is best known for his famous equation E=mc², which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, providing significant evidence for the particle theory of light.\n",
