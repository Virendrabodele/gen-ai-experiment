"""
Chess Team Battle
---------------------------------
This example shows how to build a Chess game where AI agents play different roles in a team.
The game features specialized agents for strategy for white pieces, strategy for black pieces,
and a master agent overseeing the game. Move validation is handled by python-chess.

Usage Examples:
---------------
1. Quick game with default settings:
   team = get_chess_team()

2. Game with debug mode off:
   team = get_chess_team(debug_mode=False)

The game integrates:
  - Multiple AI models (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
  - Specialized agent roles (strategist, master)
  - Turn-based gameplay coordination
  - Move validation using python-chess
