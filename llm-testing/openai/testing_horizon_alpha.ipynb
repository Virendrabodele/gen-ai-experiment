            "- Because of this, measurements of time and space can differ for people moving relative to each other.\n",
            "  - Time dilation: A moving clock runs slower compared to a stationary one.\n",
            "  - Length contraction: Moving objects are measured shorter along the direction of motion.\n",
            "  - Relativity of simultaneity: Events that seem simultaneous to one observer may not be to another.\n",
            "- E=mc²: Energy and mass are two forms of the same thing.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) General relativity key ideas:\n",
            "- Gravity isn’t a pull through space; it’s the bending of space and time (spacetime) caused by mass and energy.\n",
            "- Objects move along the straightest possible paths in this curved spacetime, which looks like gravity to us.\n",
            "- Predictions and effects:\n",
            "  - Light bends around massive objects (gravitational lensing).\n",
            "  - Time runs slower in stronger gravity (gravitational time dilation).\n",
            "  - Orbits precess slightly (like Mercury’s orbit).\n",

            "- GPS needs relativity corrections (both special and general) to stay accurate.\n",

            "- Lower rates do the opposite, supporting higher price-to-earnings multiples.\n",
            "\n",
            "2) Cost of capital and corporate profits\n",
            "- Rate hikes raise borrowing costs for companies (loans, bonds), which can reduce investment, slow expansion, and squeeze margins—particularly for highly leveraged firms.\n",
            "- Cuts reduce financing costs, potentially boosting profitability and capital spending.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) Consumer demand and the real economy\n",
            "- Higher rates cool consumer spending via more expensive credit (mortgages, auto loans, credit cards). Slower demand can hit cyclical sectors (discretionary, industrials).\n",
            "- Lower rates support demand, benefiting sectors sensitive to consumer and business spending.\n",
            "\n",
            "4) Sector rotation effects\n",
            "- Growth/tech: More sensitive to discount-rate changes; often fall when rates rise and outperform when rates fall, all else equal.\n",
            "- Financials: Banks can benefit from rising rates if net interest margins improve, but aggressive hikes that slow growth or raise credit risk can offset benefits.\n",
            "- Utilities/REITs: Often trade like bond-proxies; higher rates can hurt due to competition from bonds and higher financing costs.\n",
            "- Energy/materials/industrials: More tied to growth expectations and commodity dynamics; rate changes influence them via growth outlook and dollar moves.\n",
            "\n",
            "5) Currency and global linkages\n",
            "- Higher rates can strengthen the domestic currency by attracting capital flows, which can weigh on exporters’ earnings when converted back and affect multinationals.\n",
            "- Lower rates can weaken the currency, potentially aiding exporters but also raising import costs.\n",
            "\n",
            "6) Liquidity and risk appetite\n",
            "- Tightening (rate hikes, balance-sheet reduction) drains liquidity, often reducing risk appetite and increasing volatility.\n",
            "- Easing adds liquidity, typically supporting risk assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "7) Inflation expectations and real rates\n",
            "- Markets care about real (inflation-adjusted) rates. If nominal rates rise but inflation expectations fall more, real rates can rise significantly, pressuring equities.\n",
            "- Conversely, falling real rates are generally supportive for equities.\n",
            "\n",
            "8) Expectations vs. surprises\n",
            "- Stocks often move on surprises relative to expectations. If a rate change is fully anticipated, the market reaction may be muted; unexpected hawkish/dovish shifts can cause sharp moves.\n",
            "- Forward guidance from central banks shapes future-rate expectations and can be as important as the current decision.\n",
            "\n",
            "9) Time horizon dynamics\n",
            "- Short term: Re-pricing of discount rates and sector rotations dominate; volatility often increases on policy days.\n",
            "- Medium to long term: The net effect depends on how policy affects growth and inflation. A moderate hiking cycle that reins in inflation without causing recession (a “soft landing”) can be constructive for equities; overtightening that triggers recession is typically negative.\n",
            "\n",
            "Key takeaways for investors\n",
            "- Focus on real rates, the yield curve, and forward guidance, not just the headline move.\n",
            "- Watch sector sensitivities: growth and bond-proxy sectors are rate-sensitive; financials hinge on net interest margins and credit quality.\n",
            "- Consider balance sheet strength; highly leveraged firms are more exposed.\n",
