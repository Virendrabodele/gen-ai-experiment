The name was chosen by Miyazaki due to his passion for aircraft and also for the idea that the studio would \"blow a new wind through the anime industry\".

He is particularly critical of Japanese animation, saying that anime is \"produced by humans who can\\'t stand looking at other humans ... that\\'s why the industry is full of otaku\\u200a!\". He has frequently criticized otaku, including \"fanatics\" of guns and fighter aircraft, declaring it a \"fetish\" and refusing to identify himself as such. He bemoaned the state of Disney animated films in 1988, saying \"they show nothing but contempt for the audience\".\\nMiyazaki considers himself \"traditionally ... a leftist in terms of emotional affinity\", emphasizing his commitment to his ideals despite changing political and economic landscapes.',\n",

The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly. All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors, and have a \"whimsical and joyful aesthetic\". Studio Ghibli\\'s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene. A notable exception is The Tale of the Princess Kaguya, directed by Takahata, which departs from Ghibli\\'s typical style by employing a soft watercolor palette and storybook-like aesthetic reminiscent of Japanese folk art. This approach aimed to reflect the emotions and inner struggles of the characters and highlight the hand-drawn animation.',\n",

She wrote that it marked a \"new chapter\" in his filmography on account of its nuanced and intermingled themes and the unprecedented scope of its production. The film was longer and more expensive to produce than any Studio Ghibli film up to that point, which Napier reported induced a high level of stress and demanded \"almost superhuman efforts\" from the entire staff, including Miyazaki. Some senior employees, worn out from the film\\'s production, left Studio Ghibli in its aftermath, with Miyazaki himself increasingly withdrawing from public relations. Suzuki recounted that Miyazaki was overtaxed from supervising the storyboards, music, and vocal recordings and had \"given his body and soul\" to the production.',\n",
