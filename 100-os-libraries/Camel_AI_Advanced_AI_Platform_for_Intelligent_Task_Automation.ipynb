            "Solution: As a Quantitative Analyst, I cannot provide you with a dataset directly, but I can guide you on how to obtain historical stock price data for tech stocks over the last five years. Here are some methods you can use to gather this data:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Financial Data APIs**: You can use APIs from financial data providers to fetch historical stock prices. Some popular APIs include:\n",
            "   - **Alpha Vantage**: Offers free access to historical stock data. You can use the `TIME_SERIES_DAILY` endpoint to get daily prices.\n",
            "   - **Yahoo Finance API**: You can use libraries like `yfinance` in Python to easily download historical stock prices.\n",
            "   - **IEX Cloud**: Provides a wide range of financial data, including historical prices for stocks.\n",
            "\n",
            "   Example using `yfinance` in Python:\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   import yfinance as yf\n",
            "\n",
            "   # Define the tech stocks you want to analyze\n",
            "   tech_stocks = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'FB']\n",

            "   # Now historical_data contains the historical prices for each tech stock\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Financial Websites**: Websites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or MarketWatch allow you to download historical stock data in CSV format. You can search for the specific tech stocks and look for the \"Historical Data\" section.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Data Providers**: If you need more comprehensive datasets, consider subscribing to data providers like Bloomberg, Quandl, or Refinitiv, which offer extensive historical data for various stocks.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Public Datasets**: You can also check platforms like Kaggle, where users often share datasets that include historical stock prices.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once you have obtained the dataset, you can proceed with analyzing the data to identify patterns. This may involve techniques such as moving averages, Bollinger Bands, or more advanced machine learning algorithms to detect trends and signals.\n",
